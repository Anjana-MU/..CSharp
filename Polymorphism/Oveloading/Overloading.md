Overloading is two or more members with same name but different signatures
Can be overloaded:
- Methods
- Constructors
- Operators

Method Overloading:
- Can be done with methods with same name and differentiating in:
	1. The number of parameters in two methods.
	2. The data types of the parameters of methods.
	3. The Order of the parameters of methods.
- Return type is not considered as part of method overloading


Operator overloading
- Can only be done in public static method
- Overloaded operators are functions with special names the keyword operator followed by the symbol for the operator being defined.
- When doing Operator Overloading at least one of the parameters that you pass should be of the class type

Usage
- Method overloads are best used when the same operation can be done in several different ways, depending on parameters 

Why?
- If we need to do the same kind of the operation in different ways i.e. for different inputs.
