Classes and Objects
	- Class is a collection of related variables and methods
	- A type that is defined as a class is a reference type.
	- Class helps you conceal data
	- Encapsulation is achieved by using Access Specifiers (Public, Private, Protected, Internal, Sealed).
	- Encapsulation is the packing of "data" and "functions operating on that data" into a 
	  single component and restricting the access to outside code.
	- Partial class, splitting the class into segments over two or more source files within the namespace.
	
	The below points are for methods:
	Public: Accessible anywhere
	Private: Accessible within the scope of the curly braces
	Internal: The code is only accessible within its own assembly, but not from another assembly
	Protected:
		- Mostly used in inheritance
The code is accessible for the current class and the class that inherits it.
