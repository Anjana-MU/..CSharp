- Lists use arrays in background to store data
- Lists are arrays without a fixed size
- Initially, even if list size is not mentioned it creates a list of some size and when that size limit exceeds the size is doubled
- Lists are automatically expandable arrays

List<T> : <T> specifies the datatype
- Lists can be resized
