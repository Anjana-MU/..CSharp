Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) is the name for a set of technologies based on the integration of query capabilities directly into the C# language.

All LINQ query operations consist of three distinct actions:
	1. Obtain the data source.
	2. Create the query.
	3. Execute the query.



	- A query is not executed until you iterate over the query variable
	- If  you want to execute the query on declaration itself, you can use .ToArray to .ToList(i.e force execution)
